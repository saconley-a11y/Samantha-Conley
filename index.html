                <p> Glow & Grow is a healthy eating guide for women looking for clean eating and sustainability. I originally created to trying breaking into the digital marketing world, but to also express my love for food and wellness. 
                    As a foodie, I understand how hard it can be to eat enjoy my youth and have fun with food while also meeting my fitness and wellness goals. I have done extensive work with perosnal trainers and registered nutritionist to 
                gain insight on how to eat maintain a healthy diet. This was an awesome way to test my creativity, as I designed, wrote, edited, and marketed the everything myself. This was also the second business endeavor I've had, so this tested different areas of my entrepreneurial skills   </p>

                <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/CoquetteCaseClub" target="_blank"> <h3>Coquette Case Club</h3> </a>
                <p> I created Coquette Case Club in the summer of 2024 just for fun. I was looking into how dropshipping worked and which markets are best for break through, and found phone cases. While the process is a bit tedious to start, it's pretty simple overall. After a lot of cost/benifit analysis and 
                    market research I found the optimal pricing and target market. I've always had an entrepreneurial fire and  bringing this in from the ground up really inspired me to keep going. I researched what designs are trendying, why, and who is purchusing them. This process overall will forever be benefital to my career 
                    as it shows drive, skills in business analysis and financial planning, and creativity.

                <p>This lab seats guests at a wedding using the same processes as the Dice game. With multiple prompt questions, the amount of guests 
                    attending the wedding are evenly distributed to a table. I especially liked this lab becasue it really solidified how prompts work and are used.
